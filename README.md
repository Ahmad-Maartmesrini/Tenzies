**Project Title:** Tenzies

**Description:**

Tenzy is a fast-paced game that can be played in a short amount of time, making it perfect for quick rounds or as a filler game between longer gaming sessions. It's a game of chance, but you can also employ a bit of strategy by deciding which dice to set hold and which ones to re-roll in order to increase your chances of getting all ten dice to match.
